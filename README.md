# IdleFactory

IdleFactory is a way for me to teach myself the web stack and also to have fun. Hopefully this turns into a good game one day!

### Roadmap/Ideas:

- implement cost to buy buildings
- combine furnaces, add mechanic to choose what they smelt
- more ores: tungsten, aluminum?
- what to do with higher tier ores? Better miners? Some other resource?
- Should there be alloys?
- upgrade system
- research?
- sell products maybe? Have a budget to balance? Upkeep on machines?

  - bankrupt if you run out of money, loss condition?
  - should there be a win condition?

- add ui elements in the middle for quantities of machines and what they are doing
- need to save progress somehow
  - browser cookie? Some other browser state?
